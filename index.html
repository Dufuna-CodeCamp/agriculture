      Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza glaberrima (African rice) or Oryza sativa (Asian rice). As a cereal grain, 
      it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia and Africa. 
      It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production (rice, 741.5 million tonnes in 2014), 
      after sugarcane (1.9 billion tonnes) and maize (1.0 billion tonnes).
    </p>
    <p>Rice is one of the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of 
      the calories consumed worldwide by humans. There are many varieties of rice and culinary preferences tend to vary regionally.
      Rice can come in many shapes, colors and sizes
      </p>
    <p>In late 2007 to May 2008, the price of grains rose greatly due to droughts in major producing countries (particularly Australia),
        increased use of grains for animal feed and US subsidies for bio-fuel production. Although there was no shortage of rice on world
        markets this general upward trend in grain prices led to panic buying by consumers, government rice export bans (in particular,
        by Vietnam and India)and inflated import orders by the Philippines marketing board, the National Food Authority. This caused 
        significant rises in rice prices. In late April 2008, prices hit 24 US cents a pound, twice the price of seven months earlier.
        Over the period of 2007 to 2013, the Chinese government has substantially increased the price it pays domestic farmers for their
        rice, rising to US$500 per metric ton by 2013. The 2013 price of rice originating from other southeast Asian countries was a 
        comparably low US$350 per metric ton. </p>

      Yam is the common name for some plant species in the genus Dioscorea (family Dioscoreaceae) that form edible tubers.[1] Yams are perennial herbaceous vines cultivated for the consumption of their starchy tubers in many temperate and tropical regions, especially in Africa, South America and the Caribbean, Asia, and Oceania.[1] The tubers themselves, also called "yams", come in a variety of forms owing to numerous cultivars and related species.[1]
    </p>
    <p>Yams in West Africa are typically harvested by hand using sticks, spades, or diggers.[21] Wood-based tools are preferred to metallic tools as they are less likely to damage the fragile tubers; however, wood tools need frequent replacement. Yam harvesting is labor-intensive and physically demanding. Tuber harvesting involves standing, bending, squatting, and sometimes sitting on the ground depending on the size of mound, size of tuber, or depth of tuber penetration. Care must be taken to avoid damage to the tuber, because damaged tubers do not store well and spoil rapidly. Some farmers use staking and mixed cropping, a practice that complicates harvesting in some cases.
        In forested areas, tubers grow in areas where other tree roots are present. Harvesting the tuber then involves the additional step of freeing them from other roots. This often causes tuber damage.
        Aerial tubers or bulbils are harvested by manual plucking from the vine. Yields may improve and cost of yam production be lower if mechanization were to be developed and adopted. However, current crop production practices and species used pose considerable hurdles to successful mechanization of yam production, particularly for small-scale rural farmers. Extensive changes in traditional cultivation practices, such as mixed cropping, may be required. Modification of current tuber harvesting equipment is necessary given yam tuber architecture and its different physical properties.
    </p>
    <p>In 2017, worldwide production of yams was 73.0 million tonnes, led by Nigeria with 66% of the global total (table).[23] Nigeria farmed yams on 5.9 million hectares, 70% of the world land area of 8.6 million hectares devoted to yam farming.[22]
        The world average annual yield of yams was 8.8 tonnes per hectare in 2017, with Ethiopia having the most productive farms of 29.2 tonnes per hectare.[22]

Small-scale farmers in West and Central Africa often intercrop yams with cereals and vegetables. </h5>

       <h1 class="display-4">Onion</h1>
    <h5 class="text-left ml-auto">The onion plant has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7,000 years. It is a biennial plant, but is usually grown as an annual. Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm (6 to 18 in). The leaves are yellowish- to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened, fan-shaped swathe. They are fleshy, hollow, and cylindrical, with one flattened side. They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up, beyond which they taper towards a blunt tip. The base of each leaf is a flattened, usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb. From the underside of the plate, a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil. As the onion matures, food reserves begin to accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells.  </h5>
  </div>
  </div>
   <p class="display-5 text-justify">
      
  Because the wild onion is extinct and ancient records of using onions span western and eastern Asia, the geographic origin of the onion is uncertain,[17][18] with likely domestication worldwide.[19] Onions have been variously described as having originated in Iran, the western Indian subcontinent and Central Asia.[17][20][21][22]

Traces of onions recovered from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that onions were used as far back as 5000 BC, not only for their flavour, but the bulb's durability in storage and transport.[23][19][failed verification] Ancient Egyptians revered the onion bulb, viewing its spherical shape and concentric rings as symbols of eternal life.[19] Onions were used in Egyptian burials, as evidenced by onion traces found in the eye sockets of Ramesses IV.[24]

Pliny the Elder of the first century AD wrote about the use of onions and cabbage in Pompeii. He documented Roman beliefs about the onion's ability to improve ocular ailments, aid in sleep, and heal everything from oral sores and toothaches to dog bites, lumbago, and even dysentery. Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after its 79 AD volcanic burial have found gardens resembling those in Pliny's detailed narratives.[19] According to texts collected in the fifth/sixth century AD under the authorial aegis of "Apicius" (said to have been a gourmet), onions were used in many Roman recipes.
    </p>
    <p>A look into the historical trend in the price of a big bag of Onions, reveals a 325% increase in the price of dry onions from an average of N20,000 recorded earlier in January 2020 to N85,000 as of November 10, 2020. Also, a 261.1% increase in the price of new onions from N18,000 to N65,000.
